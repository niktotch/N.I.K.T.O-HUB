-- This Lua program generates a Roblox script function that runs every time the player respawns.

-- Define the Roblox script function
local function onPlayerRespawn(player)
    -- Add your custom logic here
    print("Player", player.Name, "has respawned!")
end

-- Connect the function to the PlayerAdded event
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    -- Connect the onPlayerRespawn function to the CharacterAdded event of the player
    player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(character)
        -- Check if the character is humanoid
        if character:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
            -- Connect the onPlayerRespawn function to the Died event of the humanoid
            character.Humanoid.Died:Connect(function()
                -- Call the onPlayerRespawn function when the player respawns
                onPlayerRespawn(player)
            end)
        end
    end)
end)

-- Example usage
print("[INFO] Starting program.")

-- Simulate a player joining the game
local player = game.Players:GetChildren()[1]  -- Assuming there is at least one player in the game
local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
character.Humanoid.Health = 0  -- Simulate the player's death

print("[INFO] Program finished.")
